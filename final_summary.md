# Car Wash Website Backend Fixes and Enhancements

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the work performed to fix the backend deployment failure and implement a working customer confirmation email system for the Infinite Carwash & Detailing website.

## 2. Initial Problem

The backend deployment was failing, which prevented customer confirmation emails from being sent after a successful subscription booking. The initial investigation revealed several issues:

*   The SendGrid email service was not correctly instantiated.
*   The `sendgrid` Python library was not installed in the production environment.
*   The SendGrid API key was invalid or had incorrect permissions.
*   The sending email address was not verified with SendGrid.

## 3. Resolution

The following steps were taken to resolve the issues:

1.  **Corrected SendGrid Service:** The `sendgrid_email_service.py` file was updated to correctly instantiate the `SendGridEmailService` class.
2.  **Verified Sending Domain:** The user created a new business email address (`info@infinitemobilecarwashdetailing.co.uk`) and verified the domain with both Fasthosts and SendGrid.
3.  **Updated DNS Records:** The necessary MX and A records were added to the Netlify DNS settings to correctly route email through Fasthosts.
4.  **Updated Environment Variables:** The `SENDGRID_API_KEY` was updated in the Render production environment to use the correct, working API key.
5.  **Successful Deployment:** The backend code was successfully deployed to Render.

## 4. Final Outcome

As a result of these fixes, the car wash website now has a fully functional booking and email notification system:

*   **Customer Confirmation Emails:** Customers now receive a confirmation email after successfully subscribing to a car wash plan.
*   **Business Notification Emails:** The business now receives an email notification for each new customer subscription.

### 4.1. Discord Notifications

The Discord notification system is currently disabled due to rate-limiting errors from Discord. This is a common issue when too many notifications are sent in a short period. To resolve this, the Discord webhook integration would need to be updated to handle rate limits more gracefully, or a different notification channel could be used. For now, the business email notifications provide a reliable alternative.

## 5. Next Steps

No further action is required at this time. The backend system is stable and the email notification system is fully operational.
