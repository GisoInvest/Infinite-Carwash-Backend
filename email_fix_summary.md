# Email Notification System Fix for Infinite Mobile Carwash & Detailing

This document outlines the steps taken to resolve the issue with the email notification system for new car wash subscription bookings.

## 1. Problem Diagnosis

The primary issue was the failure of the system to send email notifications to the business email address (`infinitemobilecarwashdetailing@gmail.com`) when a new subscription was created via Stripe. The root causes were identified as:

*   **Gmail App Password Authentication Failure:** The initial attempts to use a standard Gmail password failed due to Google's security measures, which require a specific "App Password" for applications to access a user's account. Subsequent attempts with a user-provided App Password also failed, suggesting a potential issue with the password itself or its configuration.
*   **Incomplete Email Service Implementation:** The original `email_service.py` file was missing several key methods for sending different types of emails (e.g., subscription confirmations, business notifications) and for generating the HTML content of those emails.
*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The webhook handler in `stripe_routes.py` did not have sufficient logging and error handling, making it difficult to diagnose the exact point of failure during webhook processing.

## 2. Solution Implemented

To address these issues, the following solutions were implemented:

### 2.1. Switched to IONOS Webmail for Email Sending

Given the persistent issues with Gmail App Passwords, we switched to using the user's IONOS webmail account for sending emails. This involved:

*   Configuring the `email_service.py` to use the IONOS SMTP server (`smtp.ionos.co.uk`), port (`587`), and the user's IONOS email address and password.
*   Updating the email service to ensure it could successfully authenticate and send emails through the IONOS SMTP server.

### 2.2. Completed and Refactored the Email Service

The `email_service.py` file was significantly improved by:

*   Adding the missing methods for sending subscription confirmation emails to customers and notification emails to the business.
*   Implementing methods to generate the HTML content for these emails, ensuring they are informative and professionally formatted.
*   Adding the necessary global instance of the `EmailService` class to make it accessible to other parts of the application.

### 2.3. Enhanced the Stripe Webhook Handler

The `stripe_routes.py` file was refactored to:

*   Include detailed logging throughout the webhook handling process, providing clear insights into the execution flow and any potential errors.
*   Improve the error handling to ensure that any exceptions are caught and logged appropriately, preventing silent failures.
*   Streamline the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

## 3. Testing and Validation

To ensure the implemented solution works as expected, the following tests were conducted:

*   **Direct Email Service Test:** A test script (`test_email.py`) was created to directly test the email sending functionality using the IONOS credentials. This test confirmed that the system could successfully send emails through the IONOS SMTP server.
*   **Webhook Handler Test:** A unit test (`test_webhook.py`) was created to simulate a `checkout.session.completed` event from Stripe. This test verified that the webhook handler correctly processes the event, calls the `create_subscription` method, and triggers the sending of both customer and business email notifications.

## 4. Deployment

The fixes have been successfully deployed to the production environment. The updated backend application is now live and can be accessed at the following URL:

## 5. Final Confirmation

The email notification system is now fully functional. When a new customer subscribes to a car wash plan, the system will automatically send a confirmation email to the customer and a notification email to the business email address (`opemipo.osekita@infinitemobilecarwashdetailing.co.uk`), ensuring that all parties are promptly informed.
